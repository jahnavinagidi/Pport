              Hi, Iâ€™m Phani ðŸ‘‹ â€” a Full Stack Java Developer who loves turning
              ideas into real, working products. Over the last 5+ years, Iâ€™ve
              built everything from scalable backend systems in Java & Spring
              Boot to intuitive frontends in React and Angular.

                I enjoy solving tricky problems â€” whether itâ€™s making apps load
                faster, keeping systems secure, or making sure an API can handle
                millions of requests without breaking. Iâ€™ve worked with cloud
                platforms like AWS, built CI/CD pipelines to make deployments
                smoother, and tuned databases so apps run lightning-fast.

              I started my tech path with a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science,
              where I first discovered my love for Java. My career began at
              Genpact, fixing real-world issues that taught me discipline and
              problem-solving. At HCL and Mindtree, I grew into building
              enterprise apps with Spring Boot, APIs, and cloud integrations.
              Walgreens and the State of New Jersey gave me the chance to craft
              scalable systems used by thousands daily.

                At T-Mobile, I worked on customer portals that directly impacted
                millions of users nationwide. Along the way, I mastered both
                backend performance and frontend creativity with React and
                Angular. Today, with 5+ years of experience, Iâ€™m driven by one
                goal: building software that makes life simpler and smarter.{" "}
